Vidwright Bridge for ComfyUI.

This package installs a small ComfyUI frontend extension. It does not add
generation nodes; it only adds a "Send to Vidwright" action to the ComfyUI
interface so the current graph can be exported as API JSON and posted back to
the embedded Vidwright app. (Package folder keeps the legacy vidwright_bridge
name so installs update in place.)

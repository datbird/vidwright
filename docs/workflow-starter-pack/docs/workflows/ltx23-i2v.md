## What This Setup Workflow Is
- A ComfyUI-importable copy of the workflow graph bundled with Vidwright.
- Use it to inspect missing nodes, model loaders, and expected filenames directly inside ComfyUI.
- This is a local workflow: expect to install the listed custom nodes and local model files before it runs successfully.

## Required Custom Nodes
- `CheckpointLoaderSimple` - Built into newer ComfyUI builds
  - Core checkpoint loader. Missing this usually means the ComfyUI install is incomplete or very outdated.

## API Key
- Not required for this workflow.

## Setup Steps
1. Import `workflows/local/ltx23-i2v.comfyui.json` into ComfyUI.
2. Let ComfyUI show any missing custom nodes, then install them in ComfyUI Manager.
3. Place the required model files into the folders listed above.
4. Re-open the workflow in ComfyUI and confirm all loaders resolve.
5. Return to Vidwright Generate and click `Re-check` before queueing.

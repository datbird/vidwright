## What This Setup Workflow Is
- A ComfyUI-importable copy of the workflow graph bundled with Vidwright.
- Use it to inspect missing nodes, model loaders, and expected filenames directly inside ComfyUI.
- This is a local workflow: expect to install the listed custom nodes and local model files before it runs successfully.

## Required Custom Nodes
- `CLIPLoader` - Built into newer ComfyUI builds
  - Core text-encoder loader. Missing this usually means the ComfyUI install is incomplete or very outdated.
  - Docs: https://registry.comfy.org
- `KSampler` - Built into newer ComfyUI builds
  - Core sampler node. Missing this usually means the ComfyUI install is incomplete or very outdated.
  - Docs: https://registry.comfy.org
- `ModelSamplingAuraFlow` - Built into newer ComfyUI builds
  - This sampler ships with newer ComfyUI builds.
  - Docs: https://docs.comfy.org/built-in-nodes/ModelSamplingAuraFlow
- `SaveImage` - Built into newer ComfyUI builds
  - Core image output node. Missing this usually means the ComfyUI install is incomplete or very outdated.
  - Docs: https://registry.comfy.org
- `UNETLoader` - Built into newer ComfyUI builds
  - Core diffusion model loader. Missing this usually means the ComfyUI install is incomplete or very outdated.
  - Docs: https://registry.comfy.org
- `VAELoader` - Built into newer ComfyUI builds
  - Core VAE loader. Missing this usually means the ComfyUI install is incomplete or very outdated.
  - Docs: https://registry.comfy.org

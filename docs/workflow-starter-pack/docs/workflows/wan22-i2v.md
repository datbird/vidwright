# Image to Video (WAN 2.2)

Animate an image into video

- **Workflow ID:** `wan22-i2v`
- **Category:** `video`
- **Tier:** `pro`
- **Runtime:** `local`
- **App Workflow JSON:** `/workflows/video_wan2_2_14B_i2v.json`
- **Starter Pack Setup Workflow:** `workflows/local/wan22-i2v.comfyui.json`
- **Setup Workflow Status:** `available`

## What This Setup Workflow Is
- A ComfyUI-importable copy of the workflow graph bundled with Vidwright.
- Use it to inspect missing nodes, model loaders, and expected filenames directly inside ComfyUI.
- This is a local workflow: expect to install the listed custom nodes and local model files before it runs successfully.

## Required Custom Nodes
- `CLIPLoader` - Built into newer ComfyUI builds
  - Core text-encoder loader. Missing this usually means the ComfyUI install is incomplete or very outdated.
  - Docs: https://registry.comfy.org
- `LoraLoaderModelOnly` - Built into newer ComfyUI builds
  - Core LoRA loader. Missing this usually means the ComfyUI install is incomplete or very outdated.
  - Docs: https://registry.comfy.org
- `SaveVideo` - Built into newer ComfyUI builds
  - Core video output support ships with newer ComfyUI builds.
  - Docs: https://docs.comfy.org/built-in-nodes/CreateVideo
- `UNETLoader` - Built into newer ComfyUI builds
  - Core diffusion model loader. Missing this usually means the ComfyUI install is incomplete or very outdated.
  - Docs: https://registry.comfy.org
- `VAELoader` - Built into newer ComfyUI builds
  - Core VAE loader. Missing this usually means the ComfyUI install is incomplete or very outdated.
  - Docs: https://registry.comfy.org
- `WanImageToVideo` - Built into newer ComfyUI builds
  - Update ComfyUI first. If WanImageToVideo is still missing afterwards, install a maintained Wan wrapper such as ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper manually.

## API Key
- Not required for this workflow.

## Setup Steps
1. Import `workflows/local/wan22-i2v.comfyui.json` into ComfyUI.
2. Let ComfyUI show any missing custom nodes, then install them in ComfyUI Manager.
3. Place the required model files into the folders listed above.
4. Re-open the workflow in ComfyUI and confirm all loaders resolve.
5. Return to Vidwright Generate and click `Re-check` before queueing.

# Vidwright v0.3.5

## Highlights

- Dramatically improved export performance for timelines that use unusually long source videos or clips with deep source in-points.
- Made all fast-pipe exports substantially faster: in testing, timelines that previously rendered around 30 fps now render at roughly 40 fps at 1080p and 75+ fps at 720p with hardware encoding.
- Added automatic lossless source preparation so long local videos can use Vidwright's faster sequential decoder instead of falling back to repeated random-access seeking.
- Reduced renderer memory pressure during long exports and improved export diagnostics.

## Long-Source Export Performance

- Vidwright now inspects long local video sources before rendering.
- Sources that are already optimized for sequential reading are reused directly.
- Sources whose movie index is not positioned for efficient decoding are temporarily remuxed as video-only MP4 files with FFmpeg's stream-copy mode.
- Stream-copy preparation does not re-encode the video and does not reduce image quality.
- Prepared sources are created only inside the export's temporary folder and are removed with the rest of the temporary export files.
- Preparation happens once per source file, even when that source appears in many timeline clips.
- If preparation is unavailable or fails, Vidwright keeps the existing standard decoder as a fallback instead of failing the export.

## Export Performance

- Frames are now delivered to the encoder through a pipelined feed (several frames in flight) instead of one blocking round trip per frame.
- GPU frame readback is now asynchronous, removing a per-frame stall while the GPU finishes rendering — at any export resolution.
- Removed a per-frame timer delay in the export loop.
- Exports write a per-phase performance breakdown to export-worker.log, and the log now keeps the last several export runs instead of only the most recent one.
- If anything looks wrong on specific hardware, setting localStorage key `vidwright-export-pipeline` to `0` restores the previous serial export behavior.

## Stability And Diagnostics

- Reduced compressed-frame read-ahead for the sequential decoder to keep memory use bounded on long, high-bitrate masters.
- Avoided loading extremely large source headers into the Electron renderer.
- Suppressed expected stream-abort messages when a decoder reaches the end of a clip or closes normally.
- Added source-preparation counts to export diagnostics so logs report how many long sources were reused, remuxed, or fell back.
- Export now verifies that FFmpeg can actually start before rendering begins, and a missing or blocked FFmpeg installation is reported with its expected location instead of a bare numeric error code.

## Notes

- The first export of a long, non-optimized source may spend a short time preparing that source before frame rendering begins.
- Preparation requires enough free temporary disk space for a video-only stream copy of each affected source.
- Actual export speed still depends on timeline complexity, effects, compositing, source codecs, storage speed, and hardware.
- Vidwright still depends on a separate local ComfyUI installation for local generation; editing and export do not require an active ComfyUI connection.

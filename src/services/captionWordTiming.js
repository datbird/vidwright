// re-lays implausibly long words at utterance edges tight against the first
// (or last) trustworthy word. Interior words are never touched, so accurate
// timings pass through byte-identical. Worst case for a genuinely drawn-out
// boundary word is a caption that lands a beat late — for captions, late by

 * Snap transcribed words into the timeline regions that actually contain

 * Whisper anchors utterances at the start of a decoded window and will
 * spread words uniformly across leading silence — a smear that duration
 * statistics cannot distinguish from slow singing. But the timeline knows
 * structurally where sound exists: generated silence cannot contain words.
 * Utterances that lie entirely inside the spans are never touched (which is
 * what keeps this safe for held sung notes and slow speech alike). For an
 * utterance that starts or ends in generated silence, the correction depends
 * on how much of it the spans vouch for: when most of its words already sit
 * in audible spans (a long program transcript whose interior tracks the real
 * clips — only the head/tail smeared into silence), only those edge words
 * are squeezed into the span boundary and every interior word passes through
 * byte-identical. A whole-utterance linear rescale here would shift minutes
 * of accurate words by the length of the leading silence — that was the
 * planets-project bug, where all 123 words came back up to 7s late. When
 * most of its words lie in silence (a short phrase spread across a mostly
 * silent timeline), whisper's wall-clock claims are globally wrong and the
 * utterance is linearly rescaled into the portion of its span it overlaps,
 * preserving word order and relative pacing. Utterances with NO span
 * overlap at all are dropped:
 * there is nothing there to transcribe, so whatever whisper produced is a
 * hallucination — prompt echo of the vocabulary hint, phantom phrases over
 * silence, non-speech markers. (When no spans are provided at all, words
 * pass through untouched — absence of information never deletes captions.)

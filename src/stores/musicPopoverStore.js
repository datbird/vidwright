/**
 * Persisted form state for the timeline Music popover.
 *
 * The popover unmounts every time it closes (including accidental
 * click-outside), so keeping the creative inputs here — instead of local
 * component state — means tags/lyrics/BPM/key/etc. survive a close and even
 * an app restart. sessionPromptIds is persisted too so the in-progress /
 * finished takes list reappears on reopen; after an app restart the job
 * registry is empty, so stale ids simply resolve to no jobs (harmless).
 *
 * durationSeconds is stored but the popover re-prefills it from the active
 * in/out range on open — matching the range is the explicit intent when one
 * is set; otherwise the last value is reused.
